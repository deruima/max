    "\n",
    "print('This is a test'\n",
    "Learn Data Science with\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have noticed, the statement is missing a closing parenthesis on the right-hand side. Usually, the error will indicate where it experienced an unexpected end-of-file, and so all we need to do here is add a closing parenthesis where the caret points.\n",

    "\n",
    "Out:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a test\n",
    "Learn Data Science with\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, adding in the closing parenthesis has shown Python where print statement ends, which allows the script to run successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "This occurrence is a reasonably simple example, but you will come across more complex cases, with some lines of code requiring multiple matchings of parentheses (), brackets [], and braces {}.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this happening, you should keep your code clean and concise, reducing the number of operations occurring on one line where suitable. Many IDEs and advanced text editors also come with built-in features that will highlight different pairings, so these kinds of errors are much less frequent.\n",

    "Both PyCharm (IDE) and Visual Studio Code (advanced text editor) are great options if you are looking for better syntax highlighting.\n",

    "This error gets triggered when Python can't detect where the end of statement or block of code is.

    "\n",
    "print(f'Michael is {ages[\"michael\"]} years old.')\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the invalid syntax in the dictionary literal on line 4. The second entry, 'jim', is missing a comma. If you tried to run this code as-is, then you’d get the following traceback:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ python theofficefacts.py\n",

    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the traceback message locates the error in line 5, not line 4. The Python interpreter is attempting to point out where the invalid syntax is. However, it can only really point to where it first noticed a problem. When you get a SyntaxError traceback and the code that the traceback is pointing to looks fine, then you’ll want to start moving backward through the code until you can determine what’s wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, there isn’t a problem with leaving out a comma, depending on what comes after it. For example, there’s no problem with a missing comma after 'michael' in line 5. But once the interpreter encounters something that doesn’t make sense, it can only point you to the first thing it found that it couldn’t understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This tutorial assumes that you know the basics of Python’s tracebacks. To learn more about the Python traceback and how to read them, check out Understanding the Python Traceback and Getting the Most out of a Python Traceback.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few elements of a SyntaxError traceback that can help you determine where the invalid syntax is in your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The file name where the invalid syntax was encountered\n",
    "    The line number and reproduced line of code where the issue was encountered\n",
    "    A caret (^) on the line below the reproduced code, which shows you the point in the code that has a problem\n",
    "    The error message that comes after the exception type SyntaxError, which can provide information to help you determine the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the file name given was theofficefacts.py, the line number was 5, and the caret pointed to the closing quote of the dictionary key michael. The SyntaxError traceback might not point to the real problem, but it will point to the first place where the interpreter couldn’t make sense of the syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two other exceptions that you might see Python raise. These are equivalent to SyntaxError but have different names:\n",
    "\n",
    "    IndentationError\n",
    "    TabError\n",
    "\n",
    "These exceptions both inherit from the SyntaxError class, but they’re special cases where indentation is concerned. An IndentationError is raised when the indentation levels of your code don’t match up. A TabError is raised when your code uses both tabs and spaces in the same file. You’ll take a closer look at these exceptions in a later section.\n",
    "Common Syntax Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "When you encounter a SyntaxError for the first time, it’s helpful to know why there was a problem and what you might do to fix the invalid syntax in your Python code. In the sections below, you’ll see some of the more common reasons that a SyntaxError might be raised and how you can fix them.\n",
    "Misusing the Assignment Operator (=)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several cases in Python where you’re not able to make assignments to objects. Some examples are assigning to literals and function calls. In the code block below, you can see a few examples that attempt to do this and the resulting SyntaxError tracebacks:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> len('hello') = 5\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n",
    "SyntaxError: can't assign to function call\n",

    ">>> 1 = 'foo'\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n",
    "SyntaxError: can't assign to literal\n",
    "\n",
    "The first example tries to assign the value 5 to the len() call. The SyntaxError message is very helpful in this case. It tells you that you can’t assign a value to a function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second and third examples try to assign a string and an integer to literals. The same rule is true for other literal values. Once again, the traceback messages indicate that the problem occurs when you attempt to assign a value to a literal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The examples above are missing the repeated code line and caret (^) pointing to the problem in the traceback. The exception and traceback you see will be different when you’re in the REPL vs trying to execute this code from a file. If this code were in a file, then you’d get the repeated code line and caret pointing to the problem, as you saw in other cases throughout this tutorial.\n",

    "It’s likely that your intent isn’t to assign a value to a literal or a function call. For instance, this can occur if you accidentally leave off the extra equals sign (=), which would turn the assignment into a comparison. A comparison, as you can see below, would be valid:\n",

    "Most of the time, when Python tells you that you’re making an assignment to something that can’t be assigned to, you first might want to check to make sure that the statement shouldn’t be a Boolean expression instead. You may also run into this issue when you’re trying to assign a value to a Python keyword, which you’ll cover in the next section.\n",

    "Misspelling, Missing, or Misusing Python Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "Python keywords are a set of protected words that have special meaning in Python. These are words you can’t use as identifiers, variables, or function names in your code. They’re a part of the language and can only be used in the context that Python allows.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three common ways that you can mistakenly use keywords:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Misspelling a keyword\n",
    "    Missing a keyword\n",
    "    Misusing a keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "If you misspell a keyword in your Python code, then you’ll get a SyntaxError. For example, here’s what happens if you spell the keyword for incorrectly:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> fro i in range(10):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n",
    "    fro i in range(10):\n",
    "        ^\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The message reads SyntaxError: invalid syntax, but that’s not very helpful. The traceback points to the first place where Python could detect that something was wrong. To fix this sort of error, make sure that all of your Python keywords are spelled correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common issue with keywords is when you miss them altogether:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> for i range(10):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n",
    "    for i range(10):\n",
    "              ^\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, the exception message isn’t that helpful, but the traceback does attempt to point you in the right direction. If you move back from the caret, then you can see that the in keyword is missing from the for loop syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also misuse a protected Python keyword. Remember, keywords are only allowed to be used in specific situations. If you use them incorrectly, then you’ll have invalid syntax in your Python code. A common example of this is the use of continue or break outside of a loop. This can easily happen during development when you’re implementing things and happen to move logic outside of a loop:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> names = ['pam', 'jim', 'michael']\n",
    ">>> if 'jim' in names:\n",
    "...     print('jim found')\n",
    "...     break\n",
    "...\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 3\n",
    "SyntaxError: 'break' outside loop\n",

    ">>> if 'jim' in names:\n",
    "...     print('jim found')\n",
    "...     continue\n",
    "...\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 3\n",
    "SyntaxError: 'continue' not properly in loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, Python does a great job of telling you exactly what’s wrong. The messages \"'break' outside loop\" and \"'continue' not properly in loop\" help you figure out exactly what to do. If this code were in a file, then Python would also have the caret pointing right to the misused keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is if you attempt to assign a Python keyword to a variable or use a keyword to define a function:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> pass = True\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n",
    "    pass = True\n",
    "         ^\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",

    ">>> def pass():\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n",
    "    def pass():\n",
    "           ^\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "When you attempt to assign a value to pass, or when you attempt to define a new function called pass, you’ll get a SyntaxError and see the \"invalid syntax\" message again.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be a little harder to solve this type of invalid syntax in Python code because the code looks fine from the outside. If your code looks good, but you’re still getting a SyntaxError, then you might consider checking the variable name or function name you want to use against the keyword list for the version of Python that you’re using.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of protected keywords has changed with each new version of Python. For example, in Python 3.6 you could use await as a variable name or function name, but as of Python 3.7, that word has been added to the keyword list. Now, if you try to use await as a variable or function name, this will cause a SyntaxError if your code is for Python 3.7 or later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of this is print, which differs in Python 2 vs Python 3:\n",
    "Version \tprint Type \tTakes A Value\n",
    "Python 2 \tkeyword \tno\n",
    "Python 3 \tbuilt-in function \tyes\n",
    "\n",
    "print is a keyword in Python 2, so you can’t assign a value to it. In Python 3, however, it’s a built-in function that can be assigned values.\n",
